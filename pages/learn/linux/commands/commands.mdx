# Commands

## Basic

### `bg`

Sends a job to background.

```bash
# syntax
bg [job_id...]
long_running_command &  # start new process in background

# example
sleep 10000 &
bg %0     # put the job with job id 0 in the background
```

- If an instant command is sent to background, it will obviously be completed instantly, for example `pwd`.
- To send a currently running job in the background use [bg](#bg) and to bring a background job to the foreground use [fg](#fg) and when executed without arguments, will take the most recent background job to the foreground..

- [`kill`](#kill) - Kill job.
- [`fg`](#fg) - Send job to foreground.
- [`jobs`](#jobs) - List active jobs.
- [`suspend`](#suspend) - Suspend execution of this shell.
- [`wait`](#wait) - Wait for a process to complete.

### `alias`

Create an alias, aliases allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the **first word** of a simple command.

```bash
# syntax
alias [name[=value] ...]

# example
alias lss="ls -lsah"
```

- use `alias -p` or just `alias` to print all currently set aliases.
- The value of an alias can be set to an expression including spaces, command options and/or variables, the expression must be quoted, either with 'Single quotes' that will be evaluated **dynamically** each time the Alias is used, or "Double quotes" which will be **evaluated once** when the alias is created.
- The value cannot contain any positional parameters ($1 etc), if you need to do that use a shell [function](#functions) instead.
- To make an alias permanent, make a file `~/.bash_aliases` using your favorite text editor and type the alias commands into the file. `.bash_aliases` will run at login (or you can just execute it with `source .bash_aliases` )

### `cd`

Change Directory - change the current working directory to a specific Folder.

```bash
# syntax
cd [Options] [Directory]

# example
cd /usr/local/sybase   # move to the sybase folder:
cd /var/log            # change to another folder:
cd -                   # quickly get back
    # pwd -> /usr/local/sybase
cd ..                  # move up one folder:
    # pwd -> /usr/local/
cd                     # back to your home folder
```

- If directory is given, changes the shell's working directory to it. If not, changes to HOME (shell variable).
- `cd -` will go back to the last folder you looked at. This does not stack, so issuing `cd -` repeatedly will just toggle between two directories, to go back further use `pushd`/`popd`.
- ./ or just . is shorthand for the current directory.

#### Useful Options for `cd`

| Options | Usage                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| `-P`    | Do not follow symbolic links    |
| `-L`    | Follow symbolic links (default) |
